This repository is for Project 2 in fys-stk 4155.

The authors of the code and report are:

Astrid Tesaker
Vemund Stenbekk Thorkildsen
Sofie Tunes

The script functions.py includes the algorithms. The functions included are:
LinearRegression
NeuralNetwork --> 


DesignDesign --> for creating design matrix
OridinaryLeastSquares --> OLS regression
RidgeRegression
k_fold_cv --> K-fold cross validation
reshaper --> Used for sorting inside k_fold_cv
N_bootstraps --> Bootstrap resampling and prediction.
Bootstrap --> The actual resampling employed by N_bootstraps.
MSE, r2, confidence_interval --> Error metrics.
The jupyter notebook main.ipynb is used for running the codes in functions.py. The jupyter notebook test.ipynb is used for benchmarking the regression functions.

The folder /figures includes all the plots that is included in the written report, with addition to some extra figures. The file SRTM_data_Norway_1.tif is the digital terrain dataset. The PDF file Project1_AT_VST_SMT.pdf is the written report.
